# Design Document

## Overview

The Nostromo Monitoring System will be implemented as a single-page web application (SPA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages static hosting. The application will simulate a retro-futuristic computer terminal interface with multiple screens representing different ship systems. The design emphasizes authentic 1979 sci-fi aesthetics through careful attention to typography, color schemes, visual effects, and interaction patterns.

The application will use a modular screen-based architecture where each ship system (dashboard, life support, navigation, engineering, crew monitoring) is represented as a separate view with consistent styling and navigation patterns.

## Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All functionality contained in static files
- **Module Pattern**: JavaScript organized into logical modules for each ship system
- **State Management**: Simple JavaScript object-based state management for system data
- **View Router**: Hash-based routing for navigation between ship systems
- **Data Simulation**: Mock data generators to simulate real-time ship telemetry

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. Terminal Interface Component
- **Purpose**: Provides the base terminal aesthetic for all screens
- **Features**: 
  - Green monochrome text (#00ff41) on black background (#000000)
  - Retro computer font (Monaco, Consolas, or custom bitmap font)
  - CRT screen effects (scan lines, subtle flicker, phosphor glow)
  - Typing animation for text appearance
  - Cursor blinking animation

#### 2. Navigation System
- **Purpose**: Handles routing between different ship systems
- **Features**:
  - Hash-based routing for GitHub Pages compatibility
  - Smooth screen transitions with retro fade effects
  - Breadcrumb navigation showing current system
  - Quick access hotkeys (F1-F8 for different systems)

#### 3. Data Display Components
- **ASCII Art Displays**: Ship schematics and status indicators using ASCII characters
- **Progress Bars**: Retro-style horizontal bars for levels and percentages
- **Status Indicators**: Blinking text and symbols for alerts and warnings
- **Data Tables**: Monospaced tabular data with proper alignment
- **Real-time Graphs**: Simple line graphs using ASCII or basic canvas drawing

#### 4. Audio System
- **Ambient Sounds**: Low-level ship humming and computer processing sounds
- **Interface Sounds**: Keyboard clicks, beeps, and system alerts
- **Background Music**: Subtle atmospheric tracks inspired by the film's score
- **Audio Controls**: Mute/unmute functionality with visual indicators

### Screen Interfaces

#### Dashboard Screen
- **Layout**: 4-quadrant display showing overview of all systems
- **Data**: Power levels, life support status, navigation summary, crew count
- **Visual Elements**: Central ship schematic with system status indicators
- **Updates**: Real-time data refresh every 2-3 seconds

#### Life Support Screen
- **Layout**: Environmental data in tabular format with trend graphs
- **Data**: Oxygen levels, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, temperature by zone
- **Visual Elements**: ASCII bar charts for gas levels, zone-based status grid
- **Alerts**: Flashing warnings for critical environmental conditions

#### Navigation Screen
- **Layout**: Star map display with coordinate grid and ship position
- **Data**: Current coordinates, heading, velocity, destination, ETA
- **Visual Elements**: ASCII star field, coordinate grid, trajectory line
- **Interactive**: Clickable star map for coordinate details

#### Engineering Screen
- **Layout**: Power distribution diagram with system-by-system breakdown
- **Data**: Power generation, consumption by system, efficiency ratings, fuel levels
- **Visual Elements**: ASCII power grid diagram, horizontal bar graphs
- **Monitoring**: Real-time power fluctuations and system status

#### Crew Monitoring Screen
- **Layout**: Personnel roster with individual status panels
- **Data**: Crew locations, vital signs, activity status, quarters environmental data
- **Visual Elements**: Crew member status grid, location schematic
- **Privacy**: Simulated data respecting crew privacy while maintaining immersion

## Data Models

### System Status Model
```javascript
{
  timestamp: Date,
  powerLevel: Number (0-100),
  lifeSupport: {
    oxygen: Number (0-100),
    co2: Number (0-50),
    pressure: Number (0.8-1.2),
    temperature: Number (18-24)
  },
  navigation: {
    coordinates: {x: Number, y: Number, z: Number},
    heading: Number (0-360),
    velocity: Number,
    destination: String,
    eta: Date
  },
  crew: Array of CrewMember objects
}
```

### Crew Member Model
```javascript
{
  id: String,
  name: String,
  location: String,
  status: String ('active', 'resting', 'offline'),
  vitals: {
    heartRate: Number,
    temperature: Number,
    oxygenSat: Number
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Data Simulation Errors
- **Fallback Values**: Default safe values when data generation fails
- **Error Logging**: Console logging for debugging without breaking immersion
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operation with limited data if components fail

### Audio System Errors
- **Silent Fallback**: Continue operation without audio if loading fails
- **User Notification**: Subtle indicator that audio is unavailable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Audio enhances but doesn't break core functionality

### Browser Compatibility
- **Feature Detection**: Check for required browser features before using
- **Polyfills**: Include necessary polyfills for older browser support
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure functionality on different screen sizes

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Data Simulation**: Test mock data generators for realistic values
- **Component Logic**: Test individual screen components and their data handling
