# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Nostromo Monitoring System is a web application that recreates the central monitoring and management interface from the commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, as depicted in the 1979 film Alien. The system will feature an authentic retro-futuristic aesthetic with green monochrome displays, terminal-style interfaces, and atmospheric sound design. The application will be deployable to GitHub Pages as a static web application, providing users with an immersive experience of operating the ship's various systems and monitoring critical functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to view the ship's overall status dashboard, so that I can quickly assess all critical systems at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a main dashboard with ship status overview
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show power levels, life support status, navigation data, and crew quarters status
3. WHEN system data updates THEN the dashboard SHALL refresh automatically without user intervention
4. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use green monochrome text on dark backgrounds consistent with 1979 sci-fi aesthetics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to navigate between different ship systems, so that I can access detailed monitoring for specific areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN on any screen THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to access different ship systems
2. WHEN selecting a system THEN the interface SHALL transition with appropriate retro-futuristic animations
3. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual design across all screens
4. WHEN accessing systems THEN the user SHALL be able to return to the main dashboard at any time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to monitor life support systems, so that I can ensure crew safety and environmental stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing life support monitoring THEN the system SHALL display oxygen levels, atmospheric pressure, and temperature readings
2. WHEN life support parameters change THEN the system SHALL update readings in real-time
3. WHEN critical thresholds are approached THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warning indicators
4. WHEN viewing life support data THEN the system SHALL show historical trends and current status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to access ship navigation and location data, so that I can monitor our position and course.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing navigation THEN the system SHALL display current coordinates, heading, and velocity
2. WHEN viewing navigation data THEN the system SHALL show destination information and estimated arrival time
3. WHEN displaying location THEN the system SHALL provide a star map or coordinate grid visualization
4. WHEN navigation data updates THEN the system SHALL reflect changes automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to monitor power and engineering systems, so that I can track energy consumption and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing engineering THEN the system SHALL display power generation, consumption, and distribution
2. WHEN viewing power systems THEN the system SHALL show individual system power draws and efficiency ratings
3. WHEN power levels change THEN the system SHALL update displays with current readings
4. WHEN critical power events occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate status indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a crew member, I want to access crew quarters and personnel monitoring, so that I can check on crew status and location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing crew monitoring THEN the system SHALL display crew member locations and status
2. WHEN viewing crew data THEN the system SHALL show individual crew member vital signs and activity
3. WHEN crew status changes THEN the system SHALL update information automatically
4. WHEN accessing quarters THEN the system SHALL display environmental conditions for each crew area

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the web application, I want the interface to have authentic 1979 Alien movie aesthetics, so that I feel immersed in the Nostromo environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL use green monochrome text on black backgrounds
2. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use retro computer fonts reminiscent of 1970s terminals
3. WHEN showing interfaces THEN the system SHALL include scan lines, subtle screen flicker, and CRT monitor effects
4. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retro-futuristic sound effects and ambient audio
5. WHEN loading screens appear THEN the system SHALL display authentic-looking boot sequences and system initialization

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be deployable to GitHub Pages, so that it can be easily hosted and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL generate static files compatible with GitHub Pages
2. WHEN deployed THEN the application SHALL function completely as a client-side web application
3. WHEN accessing the deployed site THEN all features SHALL work without requiring server-side processing
4. WHEN updating the application THEN the deployment process SHALL be automated through GitHub Actions
